# Data Visualization Projects
</div>

This repository contains a collection of data visualization projects and homework assignments. It explores various techniques and tools for presenting data in a clear, concise, and insightful manner. The projects range from basic chart implementations to more complex interactive visualizations, focusing on effectively communicating information and patterns within datasets.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Diverse Data Visualization Techniques:** Includes examples of choropleth maps, bar charts, violin plots, pie charts, and streamgraphs.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Demonstrates dynamic updates and user-driven explorations through interactive controls and tooltips.
*   **Homework Assignments:** Showcases practical applications of data visualization principles through structured exercises.
*   **Data Preprocessing Examples:** Contains notebooks illustrating data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
*   **Use of D3.js:** Leverages the power and flexibility of D3.js for creating custom and interactive visualizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pratimaprasad17/pratimaprasad17.data-viz.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd pratimaprasad17.data-viz
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies. While no specific `package.json` is provided for npm, ensure you have a local server set up and D3.js included in your HTML files.

## üöÄ Usage

To run the data visualization projects:

1.  Open the `index.html` file of the desired project in a web browser. For example, for the main project:

    ```bash
    open Data\ Visualization\ Project/Devansh-Soham-Nihar-Pratima-Kalyani-Rutwik-devansh-nihar/index.html
    ```

2.  Interact with the visualizations through available controls such as dropdown menus, date/time pickers, and other interactive elements.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The project relies on the following major dependencies and tools:

*   **D3.js (v7):** A JavaScript library for manipulating the DOM based on data. Used for creating and updating visualizations.
*   **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework for styling HTML elements, providing a responsive layout.
*   **jQuery:** A JavaScript library for simplifying HTML DOM traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling and animation.
*   **Popper.js:** A library used to position tooltips and popovers in web applications.
